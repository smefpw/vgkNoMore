An application which is designed to disable Riot Games Vanguard, by editing it's service config.
Requires restart.

The service cannot be stopped in the current session, I have already attempted to.

This program is riddled with inconsistent MessageBox error messages or console error messages. I cannot decide what I like more :/.
Tbf this whole source is an inconsistent mess.
