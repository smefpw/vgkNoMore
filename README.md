# vgkNoMore [![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C%2B%2B-%23f34b7d.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
An application which is designed to disable Riot Games Vanguard, by editing it's service config.
Requires restart.

~~The service cannot be stopped in the current session, I have already attempted to.~~
Since the Vanguard update on the 27th of April 2020 the service can now be stopped. I shall update the program shortly.

This program is riddled with inconsistent MessageBox error messages or console error messages. I cannot decide what I like more :/.
Tbf this whole source is an inconsistent mess.

An application which will check the current status of the Vanguard service. The tool will report whether Vanguard is running and if it's set to auto-start.
